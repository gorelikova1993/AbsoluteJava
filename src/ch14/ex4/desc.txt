Write a generic class, Marks, with a type parameter M where M is a numeric object
type (e.g., Integer, Double, or any class that extends java.lang.Number). Add
a method named orderAverage that takes an ArrayList of type M and returns
a double type data which is the average of the values in the ArrayList. Use the
doubleValue() method in the Number class to retrieve the value of each number
as a double. Test your method with suitable data. Your program should generate
a compile-time error if your average method is invoked on an ArrayList and a
nonnumeric element is encountered (e.g., Strings).
